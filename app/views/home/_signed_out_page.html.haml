      COBWEB allows users to store energy use data from multiple sources in one place, to map that data, to apply standard analytical procedures, and to export data for more detailed analysis. 

      %ul
        %li Identify buildings, blocks, estates and districts that are relatively high or low energy users for improvement.
        %li Correlate data with information from own databases to inform partnerships with energy companies, Green Deal and installation companies. 
        %li Support more effective targeting of retrofit activity and the associated investments by local authorities and third parties.
        %li Social housing providers, organisation with large property portfolios, facilities managers and even community groups can understand energy profile of own stock.
        %li Linking property level geo-data with real time smart metering data can significantly enhance the management of energy systems and the participation of consumers within it.
